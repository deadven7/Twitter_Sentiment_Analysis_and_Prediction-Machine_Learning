# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the sentiment of tweets based on specific phrase searches. It also explores predicting follow-up phrases to understand the context and progression of conversations on Twitter.

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately determine the sentiment of tweets and predict subsequent phrases in a conversation thread.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines whether the sentiment of a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Phrase Prediction**: Predicts possible follow-up phrases based on the context of the conversation.

## Methodologies
### Data Collection
- Tweets are collected based on specific keywords or phrases using Twitter API.

### Model Development
- Machine learning models are trained to classify the sentiment of the tweets.
- Sequence models are used to predict subsequent phrases in a conversation.

## Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook for implementing the models.
- Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.

## Results
- The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in sentiment classification and the relevance of the predicted phrases.

## Discussion
- Insights on the effectiveness of different models and techniques in understanding and predicting Twitter conversations.

## Conclusion
This project enhances the understanding of social media dynamics and provides tools for better interaction analysis.
